		<p>RULES ON SPORTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.1. AUSTRALIAN RULES FOOTBALL<br />
The bookmaker accepts bets:<br />
on regular time of 80 minutes (four quarters of 20 minutes each or two halves of 40 minutes each)<br />
on regular time including overtime (labeled &ldquo;Including Overtime&rdquo;).<br />
The bookmaker bears no responsibility for any inaccurate declaration of the duration of a match. Details shown in the &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; and &ldquo;Live&rdquo; sections are indicative only. The Customer should check the rules against official sources.<br />
Should a match be interrupted before the expiration of 80 minutes, all bets thereon will be settled at odds of 1, except for those markets which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the match was interrupted.<br />
If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such.<br />
To Score First Goal. If the player has not participated in a match or is introduced as a substitute after the first goal has been scored, all bets on this player will be deemed void. Bets on players who had been substituted or sent off before the first goal was scored will lose. If the first goal is scored by a player on whom no price has been offered, all bets on other players will lose, except for the &ldquo;Any Other Player&rdquo; market. If a match has been interrupted before the first goal is scored, all bets will be canceled.<br />
A goal (6 points) is when the ball is kicked between the narrower inner goal posts without touching another player, and the scoring team gets 6 points.<br />
A behind (1 point) is when the ball is kicked between an inner goal post and an outer behind post, or the ball hits the goal post, or passes over the gate line or the behind line.<br />
Bets on &ldquo;HT-FT&rdquo; markets are accepted on the half-time and the entire match.<br />
9.2. AMERICAN FOOTBALL<br />
The bookmaker accepts bets:<br />
on regular time (60 minutes of play consisting of four quarters of 15 minutes each);<br />
on regular time including overtime (labeled &ldquo;Including Overtime&rdquo;).<br />
If a match starts but is not completed, all bets thereon will be settled at odds of 1, except for those markets which had already been determined at the time the match was interrupted.<br />
At least 55 minutes of play must elapse for bets to stand. In this event, all bets will be settled based on the results at the time the match was stopped.<br />
For bets on &ldquo;Higher At The End Of The Tournament&rdquo; markets, if the teams fail to qualify from the group, bets will be settled based on their respective places within the group. If teams take equal places, bets will be settled based on their score.<br />
Highest (Lowest) Scoring Quarter - Total. Should there be two or more highest (lowest) scoring quarters with the same total, no stakes shall be refunded. In this event, bets will be settled based on the total.<br />
Highest Scoring Quarter. If it is impossible to determine the highest scoring quarter unconditionally (i.e. if two or more quarters end with the same score), bets on such quarters will be settled at odds of 1. Bets on other quarters will be deemed lost.<br />
Highest Scoring Half. Should both halves end with the same score, bets will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
If a match including overtime ends in a draw, W1 and W2 bets will be settled at odds of 1 (stakes will be refunded), while bets on total and handicap markets will be settled based on the match result.<br />
9.3. BADMINTON, TABLE TENNIS, BEACH VOLLEYBALL<br />
If the start of a match is delayed or postponed for any reason, all bets will stand until the match or the tournament in which the match features has concluded or until the withdrawal of one of the participants.<br />
Should a match be interrupted due to the withdrawal or disqualification of either team in the first game/set, all bets will be settled at odds of 1, except for those markets which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the match was interrupted. Bets on the match winner will be settled at odds of 1 in this case.<br />
Should a match be interrupted due to the withdrawal or disqualification of either team, the first game/set must have been completed for bets on the winner of the match to stand, otherwise all bets on this outcome will be settled at odds of 1. In the event of the withdrawal or disqualification of a player, a forfeit will be declared.<br />
If a match starts, but is not completed for any reason (for example, if one of the opponents refuses to continue or is disqualified) and more than two games/sets have been played, the outcomes which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the match was interrupted (for example, the outcome of the first game/set, total of the first game/set, etc.) will count towards the bet settlement. Payouts on other bets will be made at odds of 1 except for bets on the winner of the match. The team which has advanced to the next round or the winner of the tournament will be regarded as the winner of the match.<br />
No bet will be canceled because of a misprint in the initials of a sportsman/sportswoman (for example, B. Smith instead of A. Smith). In this event, bets will stand.<br />
&quot;Win The Match&quot;. If any of the players named in the outcome is substituted before the start of the match, all bets shall be deemed void.<br />
Handicaps and totals for the aforementioned sports must be specified in points except for &ldquo;Handicap By Sets&rdquo; and &ldquo;Total Sets&rdquo; markets.<br />
&quot;Winner&quot;. The sportsman/sportswoman (the team) who takes first place in the tournament will be considered the winner. If the sportsman/sportswoman withdraws from the tournament before it begins, bets on that sportsman/sportswoman will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
&quot;To Qualify&quot;. The Customer should predict which player of the two listed will advance further in the tournament bracket. If both players are eliminated from the tournament, the one who has advanced further in the bracket will be deemed the winner. If both players are eliminated from the same round, bets will be settled at odds of 1. If the player withdraws from the tournament before it starts, bets will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
9.4. BASKETBALL<br />
The bookmaker accepts bets:<br />

Otherwise all such bets will be settled at odds of 1. Bets on other outcomes will be canceled (settled at odds of 1) except on outcomes which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the match was interrupted.&nbsp;<br />
In the event of withdrawal or disqualification, the player in question forfeits.<br />
Example 1. The match Rodriguez vs. Herbert is interrupted with the score at 1:0 (6:2, 0:3) due to the withdrawal of Rodriguez. The following bets will be settled at odds of 1: Handicap 1 (-2.5) Games, Handicap 2 (+2.5) Games, Total Games (21.5), Sets Score 2:0, 2:1 and 1:2. All bets on the first set will be settled.

Example 2. The match Benneteau vs. Klein is interrupted with the score at 1:1 (6:4, 0:6, 0:1) due to the withdrawal of Benneteau. The bet &ldquo;Total Games Over 21.5&rdquo; will win, while the bet &ldquo;Total Games Under 21.5&rdquo; will lose as the minimum number of games possible to determine a winner is now 22: 1:2 (6:4, 0:6, 0:6).

In the deciding set of a tennis match, handicaps and totals are settled based on the score, while for bets on match handicaps and totals the deciding set is considered as one game.&nbsp;<br />
For example, Gr&ouml;nefeld/Peschke &ndash; Niculescu/Zakopalov&aacute;. Total Under 21.5. The score is (6:3, 3:6, 4:10 points). The third set will be considered as one game. The total will be 6+3+3+6+1=19. The bet wins.<br />
In respect to tennis matches labeled &ldquo;champ. tie-break&rdquo; or &ldquo;super tie-break&rdquo;, handicaps and totals in the match will be settled including the score in any super tie-break.<br />
For example, Gr&ouml;nefeld/Peschke vs. Niculescu/Zakopalov&aacute; (champ. tie-break). Total Under 21.5. The score of the match is (6:3; 3:6; 4:10 points).<br />
The total here amounts to 6+3+3+6+4+10=32. The bet loses.<br />
In certain tournaments a super tie-break (champion&#39;s tie-break) is played instead of a final deciding set. The player (pair) who first scores 10 points will be declared the winner of the match provided that they beat their opponent by at least a two point margin.<br />
&quot;Correct Score&quot; (score based on sets). The respective bets in the &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; section are 2:0, 2:1, etc.<br />
&quot;To Qualify&quot;. The Customer should predict which of two named players will advance further in the tournament bracket. Should both players retire from the tournament, the one who has progressed furthest in the tournament bracket will be deemed the winner. Should both players retire from the same round, the winning odds will amount to 1. If a player withdraws from the tournament before its start, the winning odds will amount to 1.<br />
&quot;Winner&quot;. The player (team) who takes first place in the tournament will be deemed the winner. Should a player withdraw before the start of the tournament, bets on that player will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
&quot;Win In The Game&quot;. The Customer should determine who will win the specified game. Games within each set are numbered consecutively. For example, should the 2nd set end with a score of 6:1, bets on the &ldquo;8th Game 2nd Set&rdquo; will be settled at odds of 1 as there has been no eighth game.&nbsp;<br />
A tie-break will be regarded as a single separate game.<br />
&quot;Points&quot;. A point is a result of a serve (each serve ultimately leads to one of the players winning a point &ndash; through a rally or a double fault).<br />
For example, &ldquo;Point 4 (8th Game) W2&rdquo; (The second player wins the 4th point (the fourth time the ball is served) in the 8th game). So if the 8th game goes as follows:<br />
&nbsp;1st point: 0-15 (player 2 won);<br />
&nbsp;2nd point: 15-15 (player 1 won);<br />
&nbsp;3rd point: 15-30 (player 2 won);<br />
&nbsp;4th point: 15-40 (player 2 won) &ndash; the bet wins.<br />

&quot;Match Tie-Break&quot;. The Customer should predict whether a tie-break will be in the match. If a match is not completed for any reason and a tie-break has already taken place, the bet &ldquo;Match Tie-Break - Yes&rdquo; will win, while the bet &ldquo;Match Tie-Break - No&rdquo; will lose. If a match is not completed for any reason and there has been no tie-break, bets on the &ldquo;Match Tie-Break&rdquo; market will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
&quot;Player First To Challenge A Line Call&quot;. The Customer should predict which player will be the first to exercise their right to challenge a line call. If neither player exercises their right to challenge a line call, bets will be settled at odds of 1.<br />
No bet will be canceled due to a misprint in the initials of a sportsman/sportswoman (for example, D. Muller instead of G. Muller). In this event, bets will stand.<br />
&ldquo;Tie-Break Score In Set&rdquo;. The Customer should predict the correct score of a tie-break.<br />
A tie-break is played in order to determine the winner of a set when the score in the set reaches 6:6. A tie-break must be played up to 7 points (the tie-break score can be 7:5, 7:4 etc.).<br />
&ldquo;W 1/2 With Any Other Score&rdquo;. This bet implies that a player will win a tie-break after a score of 6:6 (or a super tie-break after a score of 9:9).<br />
Example 1. Klein (Australia) vs. Klec (Slovakia). W1 With Any Other Score.<br />
&nbsp;The tie-break ends with the score (7:3) &ndash; the bet loses.<br />
&nbsp;The tie-break ends with the score (8:6) &ndash; the bet wins (as Player 1 won after a score of 6:6).<br />
&ldquo;Match Tie-Break Score&rdquo;. The Customer should predict the correct score of the tie-break.<br />

Bets on the &ldquo;Tie-Break Score&rdquo; markets will be settled at odds of 1 if there has been no tie-break in the match or in the set, or if the match has not been completed for any reason.<br />
&ldquo;Set To Finish 6:0 (0:6) In The Match &ndash; Yes&rdquo;. The bet will win if the score of any set in the match will be either (6:0) or (0:6).<br />
&ldquo;Player To Lose 1st Set But Come Back To Win&rdquo;. The bet will win if a player loses the first set but goes on to win the match.<br />
&ldquo;Sets Scoring&rdquo;. For example, the bet &ldquo;1st Set &gt; 2nd&rdquo; will win if there are more games in the first set than in the second set.<br />
Bets on a game which was played as a tie-break in the set will be settled at odds of 1 (stakes will be refunded). Games within each set are numbered consecutively for betting purposes.<br />
Statistics (number of aces, number of double faults, first serve percentage, etc.) are quoted subject to information on the respective official websites of the specific tournaments.<br />
Bets on specific statistics (number of aces, number of double faults, first serve percentage, etc.) are settled in the following manner when a match is not completed for whatever reason. Outcomes which had already been unconditionally determined at the time the match was interrupted will count towards the bet settlement. Payouts on other bets will be made at odds of 1.<br />
A match point is a point which if won by one of the players will also win them the match.<br />
&ldquo;Break Number 1 &ndash; Player 1&rdquo;. The bet will win if Player 1 is the first to win a game when receiving serve (a break point is a point that, if won by the receiving player, will win them the game. This is called a break of serve.).<br />
&ldquo;Total Points In First Game Over (5.5)&rdquo;. This is a bet on the number of points in the first game. For example, if the game is won after the score (40:30), there have been 6 points and the bet wins.<br />
In the &ldquo;Highest Scoring Period&rdquo; markets only the first and second sets are taken into account. The bet &ldquo;Highest Scoring Period &ndash; Draw&rdquo; will win if, for example, the score is (6:3, 3:6, 6:4). The bets &ldquo;Highest Scoring Period &ndash; 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Highest Scoring Period &ndash; 2&rdquo; will lose if the number of games in the first set is equal to the number of games in the second set.<br />
&ldquo;Highest (Lowest) Scoring Set &ndash; Total&rdquo;. Bets on the Total markets will be settled subject to the rules of the respective tennis tournament (i.e. if players have to play until they have won 2 sets or 3 sets).<br />
&ldquo;Who Will Make More Breaks&rdquo;. There are three outcomes in this market: Player 1, Player 2 and Draw. Should players have an equal number of breaks in the match, the selection &ldquo;Draw&rdquo; will win.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;Player To Win Their Serve After Score 0:40 &ndash; Yes&rdquo;. The bet will win if a player is losing their service game with a score of 0:40 but then goes on to win the game.<br />
&quot;Tie-Break or extra games in the final set&quot;. The last 3rd set (&ldquo;Best of 3&rdquo; match) or 5th set (&ldquo;Best of 5&rdquo; match) are taken into account to settle bets.<br />
&ldquo;First Line Call Challenge To Be Successful &ndash; Yes/No&rdquo;. If both players have not exercised their right to challenge a line call, the winning odds will amount to 1.<br />
FAST4 tennis matches are either best-of-three sets (two sets must be won) or best-of-five sets (three sets must be won). A set lasts until four games have been won. If the score is 3:3, a tie-break is awarded. The tie-break is won when a player reaches 5 points but there is no need for a two-point margin, meaning that the tie-break can end with a score of 5:4. If the score in the tie-break is 4:4, the receiving player or team selects which side (right or left) the ball will be served. In a tie-break players will change ends after the first 4 points have been played.<br />
